# Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing - September 2023 SoftUni course.
## Tasks for exercise in class and for homework for the course and my solutions.

## About the Course

The course explores fundamental concepts in programming that form the basis for effective and high-quality learning in the professional modules on automated testing. Participants build upon the knowledge acquired in the QA Fundamentals (Manual) module and begin to study basic programming techniques such as writing program code at an introductory level (basic coding skills), working with an integrated development environment (IDE), using variables and data, operators and expressions, console operations (reading input data and printing results), utilizing conditional constructs (if, if-else), loops (for, while, do-while), and component testing.

The course also covers basic programming structures such as arrays and lists. It successfully provides students with an understanding of the upcoming professional modules and the knowledge they will gain from them to become successful professionals in "automated software testing."

## Skills you will acquire:

- Component testing (Unit Testing)
- Handling the standard functionality of the programming language
- Working with linear data structures
- Declaring and invoking methods
- Working with fundamental concepts of automated testing
